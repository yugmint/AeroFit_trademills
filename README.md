**Project Title:** Aerofit Treadmill Customer Analysis

**Description:**
This repository contains the implementation of a comprehensive data analysis project aimed at understanding the characteristics of the target audience for each type of treadmill offered by Aerofit, a leading brand in fitness equipment. The project focuses on providing actionable insights to the market research team at Aerofit to enhance customer recommendations and segmentation strategies.

**Business Problem:**
The market research team at Aerofit aims to identify the key characteristics of customers purchasing different types of treadmills offered by the company. By investigating potential differences across product lines with respect to customer demographics and preferences, the team seeks to improve recommendations for new customers.

**Dataset:**
The dataset used for this analysis comprises information on individuals who purchased a treadmill from Aerofit stores over the past three months. It includes features such as product purchased, age, gender, education level, marital status, usage frequency, income, self-rated fitness level, and expected weekly distance.

**Project Objectives:**
1. Perform descriptive analytics to create customer profiles for each Aerofit treadmill product.
2. Construct two-way contingency tables and compute marginal and conditional probabilities for each treadmill product.
3. Detect outliers and investigate the effect of features like age and marital status on the product purchased.
4. Explore correlations among different factors using visualizations like heatmaps and pair plots.
5. Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the analysis results.

**Usage:**
1. **Data Import and Analysis:** Start by importing the dataset and performing initial data analysis steps, including checking the dataset structure and characteristics.
2. **Outlier Detection:** Use boxplots and descriptive statistics to detect outliers in the dataset.
3. **Feature Analysis:** Investigate the effect of features like marital status and age on the purchased product using countplots, histograms, and boxplots.
4. **Marginal Probability Calculation:** Compute the marginal probabilities for each treadmill product using pandas.crosstab.
5. **Correlation Analysis:** Explore correlations among different factors using heatmap visualizations or pair plots.
6. **Customer Profiling:** Categorize users based on their characteristics and purchasing behavior.
7. **Probability Calculation:** Calculate marginal and conditional probabilities to answer specific questions about customer behavior.
8. **Recommendations and Insights:** Provide actionable recommendations and insights based on the analysis findings.
